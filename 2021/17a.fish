# We will visit the exact same spots on the way up and down.
# The higher velocity we have when landing, the further up we must have been.
# Because at the peak, the velocity is 0. The higher up, the more steps it will
# take to get down. The more steps down, the more increase in velocity.
# If we go from the point of the target furthest away to 0 in one step, that
# should be the maximum possible velocity that also hits 0 (the starting point).
# So we can start from the end and work out what `y` will be when the velocity
# hits 0 (the peak).
